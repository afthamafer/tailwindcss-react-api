# Passion project

This project is built in [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS  ](https://tailwindcss.com/), , [Open Weather API ](https://openweathermap.org/current), And [Google Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/)

## About

This project is inspired by this [Design](https://xd.adobe.com/view/988da839-dd61-4b95-9fa8-c0159b130b61-cdde/) and gave it my own twist to it.

In this app you can Check out the weather , the time and date and the data received from the database.

Weather = Openweather API <br>
Time and date = Vanilla Javascript <br>
Read data (Takenlijst) = Google Firebase <br>
 
This database is connected to this repository [Repository](https://github.com/afthamafer/Google-Firebase-CRUD-Data) and makes it possible to use the CRUD elements.
All the changes will be applied to this project when that repository is used.

With Tailwind CSS i made the layout of the website. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. Its responsive and is easy to use for a beginner like me.

# What is Tailwind

Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework. In contrast to other CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Materialize CSS it doesn't come with predefined components. Instead Tailwind CSS operates on a lower level and provides you with a set of CSS helper classes.

# What do I need to use Tailwind

- To use Tailwind you need [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- A code editor of choice. I recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

# Installation
 To install Tailwind CSS and to make sure you download the latest version check out the documentation [Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)

## About

Trying out some basic Tailwind configuration and css

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
